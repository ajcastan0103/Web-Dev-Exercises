    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p class="Hobbies">
        During my elementary, up until my highschool years at Monsignor Percy Johnson Secondary School, extracurricular activities I did were marital arts, 
        volleyball and string instruments(violin).Growing up, I have always been a big fan of video games, and animated movies. That was the
        gateway into my strong interest into how these products were made with computers and technology, which then further 
        introduced me to the concept of <i>Computer Science</i>.

            <h4>What is Computer Science?</h4>
            <article>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines
                  to practical disciplines. Computer science is generally considered an area of 
                  academic research and distinct from computer programming. (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Wikipedia)</a></article>
