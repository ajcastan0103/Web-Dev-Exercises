            <h1>Lab 3 Responsive Layout Short Report</h1>
            <p>
                As for Part A (Pure HTML and CSS), I felt it to be a bit easier to do given with prior knowledge of CSS, and I had more control with
                each element. However, working with the grid I found to be a bit challenging. However, once fully understanding it made
                designing the layout of the page easier for me. For example, positioning my "aside" bar (with columns, to the right side of my page).
                Making the page responsive in general I found to be more difficult here than with Bootstrap.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Making the webpage Part B (with Bootstrap) at first was more difficult to learn than Part A, as it 
                contained a learning curve to understand and use the formatting and classes given by Bootstrap. After learning how to use and implement
                Bootstrap, I found the process of Part B much easier than complete CSS in Part A, especially when making each page responsive. 
                I do however feel that pure CSS is more customizable than Bootstrap. Overall, I found Part B easier and more intuitive.
