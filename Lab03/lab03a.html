            <p>Grecia today with his prosthetic beak</p>
            <p class="article">
                Grecia is a chestnut-mandibled toucan and was born in the wild in or around Grecia, in Costa Rica in 2014.
                In 2015, Grecia lost half of his beak after being beaten by a group of teenagers.
                It sparked outrage across the globe, with people donating thousands of dollars to help him.
                <br />
                <br />
                Animal rescuers and veterinarians enlisted a team of volunteer experts tasked with replacing Greciaâ€™s beak,
                and ultimately received a 3D-printed prosthetic, being the first bird to recieve a prosthetic beak. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Grecia received his name from the town of Grecia where he was picked up by city officials.
                Today, he has returned to living his life as a normal bird and has become an icon in Costa Rica.
                He represents figure of courage and symbolizes animal cruelty. Not only does technology benefit people's lives,
                it also can benefit animals.
